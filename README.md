# Cryptographic project
 3rd year first semester
 

The algorithm encrypt a sentence with RSA then decrypt it with RSA and RSA-CRT protocols and save the cpu time spended to compute both.
The purpose of this project was to show that CRT indeed speed up the RSA decryption protocol.

Here are the results:
